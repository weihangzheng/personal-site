# Intro

I'm a post 3rd year coop student in my Computer Engineering undergraduate degree at University of Toronto, minoring in Artificial Intellgience and Business. I have previously interned at Cerebras Systems as a Software Engineer on ML Frameworks team, and UofT Multimedia Lab as a Undergraduate Researcher on the topic of Neural Architecture Search. I'm in interested in building new stuff around the topics of Software Engineering/Development, Machine Learning Engineering/Research, Operating Systems, and Computer Networks.

# Currently

I'm currently 4/16 months into my PEY Co-op term at UofT, now seeking a (preferably) Toronto based or remote internship position that starts immediately (the earlier the better). I'm comfortable in C, C++, and Python. I'm interested in anything related to any of the topics above, so don't hesitate to reach out to me at weihang.zheng@mail.utoronto.ca or 778-917-6809 should the opportunity arise!
