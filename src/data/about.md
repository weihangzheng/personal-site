# Intro

I'm interested in building new stuff around the topics of Software Engineering/Development, Machine Learning Engineering/Research, Algorithm Design, Operating Systems, and Computer Networks. I'm a post-3rd-year coop student in my Computer Engineering undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto, minoring in Artificial Intelligence and Business. I have previously interned at Cerebras Systems as a Software Engineer on the Machine Learning Frameworks team and UofT Multimedia Lab as an Undergraduate Researcher on Neural Architecture Search, where I published one paper, CONetV2, under Professor Kostas Plataniotis.
 
I'm now seeking a new internship position. I'm interested in anything related to any of the topics above, so don't hesitate to reach out to me at weihang.zheng@mail.utoronto.ca or 778-917-6809 (I prefer email) should the opportunity arise!
 
I dream of making the world a better place with logic and innovation, a world where there is no bias or discrimination toward anyone, and a world Everyone gets along in a productive and not personal work environment. As a highly logical, efficient analytical INTJ-A, I strive for innovation and improvement in myself and any system around me.
