	Experiences
Cerebras Systems — Software Engineering Intern (ML Frameworks)
Toronto, CA ᐧ May 2022 - Aug 2022
* Wrote unit tests in Pytest to ensure that a Tensorflow model/estimator can be lowered to MLIR dialects to be compiled on the Cerebras Wafer-Scale engine in different modes of execution 
* Worked with docker containers, volume mounts, and virtual environments to ensure that customers can run the above lowering locally with the packages given by installing our custom python wheel
* Used subprocess calls and bash scripts to ensure that different versions of Tensorflow can lower custom-made Tensorflow models to the similar MLIR dialects
* Fixed race conditions that occurred in CI tests by fixing makefiles and configuring docker container names with uuid 
* Investigated major bug fixes and code cleanup to the company-wide python auto-formatting tool that relied on autoflake, black, isort
* Manipulated C++ GRPC code to modify the directories where the above compile artifacts (generated during the lowering) are stored in local directories


UofT Multimedia Lab — Undergraduate Researcher
Toronto, CA ᐧ May 2021 - Aug 2021
* Neural Architecture Search, NP-hard Channel Size Optimization on Convolutional Neural Networks
* Devised mathematical metrics and aggregation methods to measure the effectiveness and learnability of individual convolutional layers  
* Parsed Pytorch models to extract an adjacency lists which tells us which layers (channel sizes) of the model depend on each other
* Utilized weight transfer techniques to speed up searching performance by ~50%
* Implemented Genetic Algorithm for Channel Size Optimization using uniform random crossover of channel size lists
* REDUCED ResNet34’s size by 33% from 15M to 10M while achieving HIGHER test accuracy on the CIFAR 10/100 dataset
* Published CONetV2 under Professor Kostas Plataniotis


Personal Projects


Tutoring Company App 
* Created a simple iOS app from scratch using Swift
* Lists out all the courses and available teachers for a small tutoring company
* Parses basic information from csv files
* Sorts courses based on teachers or teachers based on courses
