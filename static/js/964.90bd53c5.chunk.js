I'm a post-3rd-year coop student in my Computer Engineering undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto, minoring in Artificial Intelligence and Business. I have previously interned at Cerebras Systems as a Software Engineer on the Machine Learning Frameworks team and UofT Multimedia Lab as an Undergraduate Researcher on Neural Architecture Search, where I published one paper, CONetV2, under Professor Kostas Plataniotis.\n \nI'm now seeking a Winter/Spring internship position. I'm interested in anything related to any of the topics above, so don't hesitate to reach out to me at weihang.zheng@mail.utoronto.ca or 778-917-6809 (I prefer email) should the opportunity arise!\n \nI dream of making the world a better place with logic and innovation, a world where there is no bias or discrimination toward anyone, and a world everyone gets along in a productive and not personal work environment. As a highly logical, efficient analytical INTJ-A, I strive for innovation and improvement in myself and any system around me.\n\n# Some history\n\n- Delivered newspaper to earn some pocket money in primary school\n- Worked at Tim Hortons for a work experience course in grade 11\n- Volunteered as a swimming instructor for little kids for my swim club\n- Qualified at the provincial level for cross country running throughout high school\n\n# I like\n\n- Running\n- Swimming\n- Gyming\n- Doing all of the above while listening to music \n- Watching the summer Olympics (track, swimming, soccer)\n- Watching Chinese dramas \n- Recording funny skits\n- Watching self improvement (redpill) videos\n- Scrolling aimlessly through reddit\n\n# Travel / Geography\n\n- Chongqing, China (\u91cd\u5e86\uff0c \u6c5f\u5317 district): birthplace\n- Vancouver, Canada (Fraser Heights, Surrey): moved there at age 3 and stayed until college\n- Toronto, Canada (Downtown): mostly stayed and planning to stay for 5 years of college\n- Notable places visited/passed as part of a road trip: Los Angeles USA (Hollywood and Disneyland), Seattle USA, San Diego USA (Seaworld and aircraft carrier), Portland USA, Boise USA, Spokane USA, Whistler CA, Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, Banff National Park \n- Airports transfered in: Beijing CN (PEK), Shanghai CN (PVG)\n\n# Fun facts\n\n- I got my tonsils surgerically removed as a little kid\n- I wore braces for a few years and still have the retainers on\n- I grew all four wisdom teeth but only removed the bottom ones\n",c=d.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,h=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return(0,l.jsx)(t.rU,(0,a.Z)({},n))};n.default=function(){return(0,l.jsx)(s.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Weihang Zheng",children:(0,l.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,l.jsx)("header",{children:(0,l.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,l.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,l.jsx)(t.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,l.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",c," words)"]})]})}),(0,l.jsx)(o(),{source:d,renderers:{Link:h},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
